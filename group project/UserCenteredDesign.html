                        First, as designers working in teams, we try to understand the context in which users may use a system. Then, we identify and specify 
                        the users’ requirements. A design phase follows, in which the design team develops solutions. The team then proceeds to an evaluation phase. Here, 
                        you assess the outcomes of the evaluation against the users’ context and requirements, to check how well a design is performing.

                    <p class="white-text">
                        In UCD, you base your projects upon an explicit understanding of the users, tasks and environments.
                         The aim of the process is to capture and address the whole user experience. Therefore, your design team should include 
                         professionals from across multiple disciplines (e.g., ethnographers, psychologists, software and hardware engineers), as well as domain experts,
                          stakeholders and the users themselves. Experts may carry out evaluations of the produced designs, using design guidelines and criteria. However, 
                          you should bear two crucial points in mind.
                         First, to span the entire user experience, you must involve the users for evaluation. Second, you'll need to ensure long-term monitoring of use.

                    <p class="white-text">
                        When your design team brings the users into every stage of the design process, you invest your effort and other resources
                         into a powerful way of finding out what works well, what doesn’t and why. Your users are an early-warning system you can
                          use to course-correct and fine-tune your design. They can expose many aspects—positive and negative—your team may have
                           overlooked regarding such vital areas as usability and accessibility.
                         That’s why it’s so important to understand how powerful the benefits of a user-centered design approach are.
